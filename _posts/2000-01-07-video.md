## FAQ

#### Does your bonded service work on Telstra DSLAMS?

*Yes!* It very much does. Our bonded service even works if you are on a rim, provided there are spare ports.

-------------------------

#### Do you have data limits?

No! We believe you should pay for the speed at which you download, not how much you download.

-------------------------

#### Who's network do you use for ADSL Services?

We use the iiNet, AAPT, Optus, Telstra and Powertel DSLAM's across Australia to provide the best possible service to our customers.

-------------------------

#### Do you support Annex-M?

On certain DSLAMS we do support Annex-M. If you are on an Annex-M DSLAM we will switch it on by default. 

-------------------------

#### Do you offer static IP's?

Yes, we do offer 1 free static IP address per customer. Just ask us or select the add-on via your Customer Portal.

-------------------------

#### Are Twitch.tv Streamers allowed on your network?

Very much so! Zeno's bonded service was born because of streamers*(the CEO is a streamer!)*, so be sure to tell our staff if you are a twitch streamer so we can ensure your connection is configured to give the best quality stream we can achieve.

-------------------------

#### Do you log *metadata* or any information about what I do on my internet connection?

No. Zeno believes that your internet connection is just that. Yours. However, we will comply with any and all legal requests from law enforcement should they arrise *(this has yet to happen)* , so keep that in mind and don't go breaking the law now.

If in the future the law changes, Zeno will keep the bare minimum information required to comply with the law.
