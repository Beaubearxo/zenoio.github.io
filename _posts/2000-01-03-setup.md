# We’re for the gamers

You’ve been on edge for the past 48 hours, waiting for the ISP to finalise the setup of your brand spanking new internet connection. Such speeds they’re offering! Heavy breathing. Much anticipation. 

You fire up your PC and start your favourite game. The connection speed is decent, but your ping is 85ms and rubberbanding all over the place. *Wait*, **what?**

Unlike other ISPs, Zeno puts gamers first. We offer great connection speeds and ultra-low latency, all the time. Fun just got a lot more **serious**.
